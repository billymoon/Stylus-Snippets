Stylus-Snippets
===============

Sublime Text plugin for Stylus Snippets (use with [Stylus plugin](https://github.com/billymoon/Stylus) instead of [emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime/)).

## About this plugin

The main [Stylus plugin](https://github.com/billymoon/Stylus) used to contain the snippets in this plugin, but was separated out into two, to allow people to use the recommended snippet expander [emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime/) for a better coding experience. This package is maintained for users who for some reason do not want to use another snippet expander, and only want the stylus snippets that used to be in the main package.

## Installation

After installing [Stylus plugin](https://github.com/billymoon/Stylus) via package control, install this [Stylus Snippets plugin](https://github.com/billymoon/Stylus-Snippets) also via package manager.

Alternatively, you can download this repo (or zip ball) into your sublime editor's plugins folder.

You should now have snippets available to use in sublime editor.

## Usage

Within a stylus file, which has syntax highlighting turned on, start typing abbreviations to expand, and then press tab, or choose an item from the inline menu to complete the snippet.

Try typing `m0` and then tab to expand to `margin:0`.

Happy coding!
